    "### Problem: *The Hyper-Local AI Culinary Logistics Agent*\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooking at home is often hindered not by a lack of cooking skills, but by the friction of logistics. While the internet provides infinite recipe inspiration, the process of translating a digital recipe into physical ingredients located in specific, real-world stores is manually intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, a user must:\n",
    "1. Find a recipe.\n",
    "2. Manually cross-reference ingredients with their pantry.\n",
    "3. Estimate quantities (converting \"3 carrots\" to purchasable weight).\n",
    "4. Decide which local store carries the specific items (e.g., specialty spices vs. generic dairy).\n",
    "5. Create a disorganized list that doesn't match the store layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop an AI Agent that acts as an orchestration layer between user, Recipe APIs (by Google Search Tool) and Grocery/Map APIs (by Google Search Tool).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent based on user's natural language request have to cravl for a reciple and provide \n",
    "products list for cooking specified dish. The list should be grouped by shops and contain also estimates of prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Included feautres\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-agent system** - SequentialAgent, Agent powered by an LLM\n",
    "- **Tools** - Google Search Tool\n",
    "- **Observability** - Logging\n",

      "Here's a straightforward approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Making the Hamburger Patties:**\n",
      "*   **Ingredients:** 85% lean ground beef is recommended for juicy burgers. You'll also need binders like egg and breadcrumbs, and seasonings such as Worcestershire sauce, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.\n",
      "*   **Mixing:** Combine the ground beef with the binders and seasonings in a large bowl. Use your hands to mix everything until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the patties tough.\n",
      "*   **Shaping:** Divide the mixture into equal portions and gently shape them into patties. Make them slightly larger than your buns, as they will shrink during cooking. Press an indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to help them cook evenly and prevent puffing.\n",
      "*   **Chilling (Optional but Recommended):** Refrigerate the formed patties for about 20-30 minutes. This helps them hold their shape better during cooking.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Cooking the Hamburger Patties:**\n",
      "You can cook your burgers on a grill or on the stovetop.\n",
      "*   **Grilling:** Preheat your grill to medium heat. Cook the patties for about 4-6 minutes per side, or until they reach an internal temperature of 160°F.\n",
      "*   **Stovetop:** Heat a heavy-based frying pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat with a little oil. Cook the patties for about 4-6 minutes per side, or until they reach an internal temperature of 160°F.\n",
      "*   **Adding Cheese:** If you're making cheeseburgers, add the cheese slices in the last 1-2 minutes of cooking and cover the pan briefly to melt the cheese.\n",
      "*   **Resting:** Let the patties rest for about 5 minutes before serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Toppings and Assembly:**\n",
      "The fun part is adding your favorite toppings!\n",
      "*   **Classic Toppings:** Lettuce, tomato slices, red onion slices, pickles, ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise are popular choices.\n",
      "*   **Other Delicious Options:** Consider bacon, caramelized onions, fried onions, cheese (cheddar, Swiss, blue cheese), avocado, bacon jam, or even onion rings.\n",
      "*   **Bun Preparation:** Toasting your burger buns can add extra flavor and prevent sogginess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once everything is ready, assemble your burgers with your preferred combination of patty and toppings, and enjoy!\n",
